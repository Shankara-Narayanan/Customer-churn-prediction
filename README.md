what is churn?

Churn refers to the rate at which customers or subscribers cease their relationship with a company or service over a specific period. It is often used in the context of businesses, particularly in industries such as telecommunications, subscription services, and software as a service (SaaS). High churn rates can indicate customer dissatisfaction or ineffective customer retention strategies, while low churn rates typically signify customer loyalty and satisfaction.
